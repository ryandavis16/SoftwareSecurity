I added the Practices for Secure Software Report to this repo. Artemis Financial is the client and they needed stronger security on a public web app. I enabled HTTPS with a self signed cert and added a SHA-256 checksum endpoint. I did well at spotting risky old libraries and at adding TLS and checksum without breaking the app. The dependency report was the hardest part to sort. I tested by running the app on port 8443 and calling the hash endpoint with my name to see the checksum. I re ran OWASP Dependency Check to confirm my refactor did not add new problems. I used Spring Boot Maven Java Keytool and curl. I kept secrets out of code and avoided PII in logs. For next steps I would use OWASP Top Ten threat modeling SAST DAST and regular version bumps. For employers I can show the secure app the checksum feature and the final report with screenshots.
